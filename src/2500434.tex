\end{center}
In recent years, especially since 2012, the number of cyber crimes in various countries has risen sharply.
Developed countries, led by the United States and Europe,
are more seriously affected by cyberattacks, and this trend may cause national data leakage and cause great losses.
Therefore, models are needed to quantify the impact of the cybercrime situation in each country under various factors.

By the size of the GCI indicator, we divided the countries into five gradients.
The typical countries in each partition are selected according to the variance and the size of the data.

First, we build a massive data-driven model to represent the cybercrime situation around the world over the years, and
visually display it in the form of heat maps.

For the global cybercrime situation under the influence of legal policies,
we also establish a huge data-driven model to represent the relationship between legal policies and crime rates of typical countries.

In order to consider the timeliness of legal policies,
we use Poisson regression analysis and introduce a time lag model to evaluate different policies in a country each year.

Based on the analysis of all the data and the theory of all the models, we come to the following conclusion:
reducing the incidence of cybercrime needs to be clear that the law has a significant lag effect,
generally starting to take effect in three years.
Effective legal forms should be more inclined to international legislation and transnational legislation,
such laws have stronger effectiveness and longer duration, and are universal to the cybercrime governance of the whole region.
The number of bills does not completely determine the improvement of the crime level of a country.
It should also take into account the overall national conditions.

The national law enforcement capacity should be improved,
and the pertinence and enforceability of law enforcement policies should be improved.
Secondly, the influence of laws and policies on cybercrime is also affected by other environmental factors,
such as GDP and education level.
Moreover, long-term legal policies are generally better than short-term ones.

%TODO

Comprehensive consideration of the above aspects can greatly control the cyber crime rate,
to make the national system more stable.
