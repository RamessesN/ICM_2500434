To enhance the model's robustness and applicability, several improvements are proposed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporating \textbf{time-series} or \textbf{panel data analysis} would capture dynamic effects,
        such as the lagged impacts of policy changes on crime rates.
    \item Integrating \textbf{machine learning} methods like random forests
        could better handle nonlinear relationships and complex variable interactions,
        addressing limitations of linear models.
    \item Developing a simplified \textbf{visualization tool} to translate complex model results
        into easily interpretable charts would improve accessibility for policymakers,
        facilitating more informed decision-making.
\end{itemize}
These steps aim to address current limitations and expand the model's practical utility.
